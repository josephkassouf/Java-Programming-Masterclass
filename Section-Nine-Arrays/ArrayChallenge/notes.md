## Arrays Recap
- An **array** is a **data structure** that allows us to **store multiple values**, of the **same type** in a single variable.
- **Default values** of **numeric arrays** are **set to 0**.
- Arrays are **Zero Indexed** so **0 to n - 1**
- Try to access an index that is out of range. Java will throw an error.
- We use **Square Brackets** to access an element from the array.
