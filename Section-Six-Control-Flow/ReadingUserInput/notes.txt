READING DATA FROM THE CONSOLE
System.in --> Like System.out, Java provides System.in which can read input from the console or terminal.

System.console --> Java's solution for easier support for reading a single line and prompting user for information.
    -> Doesn't work with I.D.E's because they disable it.
    -> java src/Main.java to run it

Command Line Arguments --> Calling the Java program and specifying data in the call.

Scanner --> Scanner class was built to be a common way to read input, either using System.in or a file.


EXCEPTION HANDLING
--> Exception: An error that happens in code.
--> Some types of errors can be predicted and named

CATCHING AN EXCEPTION
An exception is caught --> by creating a code block around the code, that might get the error.
    -> This is done with the try statement code block.
    -> try {
        statements that might get errors
    } catch (Exception e) {
        code to handle the exception
    }


THE SCANNER CLASS
--> Scanner class is described as a simple text scanner, which can parse primitive types and strings.
--> To use the Scanner class, we have to create an instance of Scanner

NEW KEYWORD
--> New keyword used in what java calls, a Class instance creation expression;
--> ClassName variableName = new ClassName();
--> And often in many cases, we can pass parameters.

INSTANTIATING SCANNER
Scanner sc = new Scanner(System.in);
