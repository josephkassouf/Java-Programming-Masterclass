SUPER
----------------------------------------------------------------
-> Used to access or call the parent class members (Variables & Methods)

-> Commonly used with method overriding when we call a method with the same name from the parent class.

THIS
----------------------------------------------------------------
-> Used to access or call the current class members (Variables & Methods)
-> Required when we have a parameter with the same name, as an instance variable or field
-> Use them anywhere in a class, except for static elements, likec a static method.
    -> Will lead to compilation error

-> this is commonly used with constructors & setters & optionally used in getters

-> Use this() to call a constructor from another overloaded constructor in the same class.
    -> this() can only be used in the constructor.
    -> Must be the first statement in the constructor.
    -> Used with constructor chaining.

CONSTRUCTOR GOOD EXAMPLE

class Rectangle {
    private int x, y, width, height;

    // 1st constructor
    public Rectangle () {                                       1st constructor calls 2nd constructor, 2nd
        this(0, 0);                                             constructor calls 3rd constructor, 3rd
    }                                                           constructor initializes the instance variables

    // 2nd constructor                                          3rd constructor does all the work
    public Rectangle (int width, int height) {
        this(0, 0, width, height);                              Known as constructor chaining, last constructor
    }                                                           has the responsibility to initialize the variables.

    //3rd constructor
    public Rectangle (int x, int y, int width, int height) {
        this.x = x;
        this.y = y;
        this.width = width;
        this.height = height;
    }
}
