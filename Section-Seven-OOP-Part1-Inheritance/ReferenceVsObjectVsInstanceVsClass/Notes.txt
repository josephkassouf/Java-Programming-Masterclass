REFERENCE VS OBJECT VS INSTANCE VS CLASS
    -> Lets use the analogy of building a house to understand classes.

    -> A class is a blueprint for the house.

    -> Using the blueprint, we can build as many houses as we like, based on those plans.

    -> Each house is an object.

    -> This object can also be known as an instance, often we'll say it's an instance of the class.

    -> Each house we build has an address (a physical location)

    -> In other words,if we want to tell someone where we live, we give them our address. This is known as a reference.
        ex: House blueHouse = new House("blue"); -> blueHouse variable is a reference to the object in memory.
