STATIC VS INSTANCE METHODS

STATIC METHODS
    -> Declared using static modifier.
    -> Static methods can't access instance methods and instant variables directly.
    -> They're usually used for operations that don't require any data from an instance of the class (from this).

    -> We can't use the "this" keyword in static methods.
    -> Whenever you see a method that doesn't use instance variables, that method should be declared as a static method.
    -> Static methods are called as ClassName.methodName(); or methodName(); only if in the same class.

INSTANCE METHODS
    -> Instance methods can access instance methods and instant variables directly.
    -> Instance methods can also access static methods and static variables directly.

STATIC OR INSTANCE METHODS
    --> Should a method be static?
        --> Does it use any fields (instance variables) or instance methods?
            --> YES? It should probably be an instance method.
            --> NO? It should probably be a static method.
